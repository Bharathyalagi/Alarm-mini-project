# ⏰ Alarm Mini Project

##A simple Python-based alarm timer that lets you set a countdown in **minutes** and **seconds**, then plays an alert sound when time’s up.

---

###  What this project does
- Takes user input for minutes and seconds.
- Counts down in real time.
- Displays the remaining time dynamically in the terminal.
- Plays a sound (`alarm.mp3`) when the countdown finishes.

---

###  Concepts used
- **While loop** for continuous countdown.
- **Time module** to pause 1 second between updates.
- **Formatted strings (f-strings)** for neat time display.
- **Playsound library** to play the audio alert.
